# Activity_14
Creating a QMD file that contains a table of Army Data, Popular Baby Names, and a Box Problem graph from previous activities. I will also use this repository to practice working with GitHub and usinh version control. 

#Data Used:
The data used in this project include: Armed Forces Active Duty Data from "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19xQnI1cBh6Jkw7eP8YQuuicMlVDF7Gr-nXCb5qbwb_E/edit?gid=597536282#gid=597536282", Pay Garde and Rank from "https://neilhatfield.github.io/Stat184_PayGradeRanks.html", and "BabyNames" from dcData.

#Current Plan:
1. Create a repository and a sub branch to commit changes to.
2. Create a qmd file and add all necessary data in.
3. Update the readme file to reflect what the documents contain/mean.
4. Update the plan file to show the process of the repository.
5. Do final commits and merge the sub branch with the main branch. 

#Repo Organization: 
Activity_14.Rproj -> An R project stored in R
README.md -> file that contains main information
Act_15.qmd -> the qmd file that will create the site/pdf of all the data
